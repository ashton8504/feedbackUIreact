# Feedback UI App

This is a React application for a Feedback UI. It allows users to provide feedback, view feedback statistics, and delete feedback entries. The app utilizes various React concepts and features, including components, props, state, event handling, context, working with a backend, CSS styling, and conditional rendering.

## Getting Started

4. Start the development server:

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Features

### Components

The app is built using a component-based architecture. Components are reusable and modular, making it easier to manage the UI elements of the application. They are organized in a folder structure, where each component resides in its own directory.

### Props

Components accept props, which are used to pass data from parent components to child components. Props allow for dynamic rendering of content and enable communication between different parts of the application.

### State

State represents the current state of the application and is used to store and manage data that can change over time. By using the `useState` hook, the app maintains state within functional components.

### Event Handling

Event handling is implemented to respond to user interactions, such as button clicks or form submissions. Event handlers are defined within components and are triggered when specific events occur.

### Context

Context is used to provide a global state that can be accessed by multiple components without prop drilling. It allows for efficient sharing of data across the application.

### Working with a Backend

The app interacts with a backend server to fetch and update feedback data. HTTP requests are made using libraries like Axios or the built-in `fetch` API to communicate with the server.

### CSS Styling

CSS is used to style the components and create an appealing user interface. The app leverages CSS frameworks or libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for faster and responsive styling.

### Conditional Rendering

Components are conditionally rendered based on certain conditions or state values. This allows for dynamic display of content, such as showing different views or hiding elements based on user input or application logic.
